        <h3>Cat Lesson #1: Cats are Magical</h3>
        <p>
            All cats from this dimension have magic abilities, unique skills, and an instictual sense of danger.
        </p>
        <h3>Cat Lesson #2: Cat Skills</h3>
        <p>
        All cats have skills! Mine are Telepathy and Telekinesis, but every cat has their own. The skills can range from anything from Fire Starting to Energy Shields! Here are a few of the more common skills.
            <ul>
                <li>Levitation: Allows the cat to levitate.(This is different from telekinesis, which levitates other objects.)</li>
                <li>Single Element Blast: Allows the cat to create elemental energy blasts from a single element. The element a cat has will not change, but will always be the same.</li>
                <li>Enhanced Senses:­ Gives the cat exceptional sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch.</li>
                <li>Single Element Shield:­ Allows the cat to create a shield from an element. Like the single element blast</li>
                <li>Gift of Sight:­ Allows the cat to see small bits of a possible future. This future is not set in stone, and can change due to the actions of those involved.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        </p>
        <h3>Cat Lesson #3: Mutations</h3>
        <p>
						Some cats have mutations. A mutation is a physiological change to the body of a cat. Mutations may include wings, forked tails, or other changes to the cats body. Not all cats are mutated, but it is only semi-rare to have a mutation. I have a mutation: angel wings!
				</p>
        <h3>Cat Lesson #4: Cats are the Best!</h3>
        <p>
            All cats are maximal elements. This means that every cat is the best and they cannot be compared to one another.
        </p>
        <h3>Cat Lesson #5: Everyone has a inner Cat</h3>
        <p>
            Hey everyone! I bet you all want to be a cat! Well, you are!
        </p>
        <h3>Cat Lesson #6: All Cats are Unique</h3>
        <p>
						Every cat has a unique set of skills and coloring. There are no two cats that are the same.
